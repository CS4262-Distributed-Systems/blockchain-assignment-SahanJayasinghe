# Blockchain Concepts

## Decentralized Consensus
A blockchain is a peer-to-peer system which has no centralized manager to monitor and control exchanging information. The devices in a blockchain network use consensus mechanisms to take decisions. Popular consensus algorithms are
* Proof of Work
* Proof of Stake
* Proof of Elapsed Time

## Proof of Work
This is a consensus algorithm used to validate the transactions and add relevant blocks to the network. It's necessary to take care of all transactional blocks since each decentralized ledger contains all information about the blocks. This mechanism requires the members of blockchain to solve an arbitrary mathematical puzzle in order to create new blocks and confirm transactions. The complexity of a puzzle depends on the maximum number of users, overall load and the minimum current power of the network.
